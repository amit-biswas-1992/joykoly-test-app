## Technical Implementation Details

### API Integration
```typescript
// API Client Configuration
class ApiClient {
  private authToken = 'eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...';
  
  constructor() {
    this.axiosInstance = axios.create({
      baseURL: '',
      timeout: 10000,
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${this.authToken}`,
      },
    });
  }
}
```

### Dashboard Data Flow
```typescript
// Dashboard Service Implementation
export const getDashboardData = async (): Promise<DashboardData> => {
  const [enrolledCourses, liveExams, upcomingExams, completedExams, practiceExams] = 
    await Promise.all([
      getEnrolledCourses(),
      getLiveExams(),
      getUpcomingExams(),
      getCompletedExams(),
      getPracticeExams()
    ]);
  
  return { enrolledCourses, liveExams, upcomingExams, completedExams, practiceExams };
};
```

### Exam System Architecture
```typescript
// Exam Question Interface
export interface Question {
  id: string;
  question: string;
  type: 'mcq' | 'written';
  options?: string[];
  correctAnswer?: string;
  marks: number;
  timeLimit?: number;
}
```

## Styling Approach

### NativeWind Implementation
- Tailwind CSS classes for React Native
- Consistent design system with semantic colors
- Responsive layouts optimized for mobile
- Modern UI components with proper spacing

### Color Scheme

## Development Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: API Response Typing
**Problem**: API responses were untyped, causing TypeScript errors
**Solution**: Implemented proper type assertions and interface definitions

### Challenge 2: Exam Timer Management
**Problem**: Timer state management across component re-renders
**Solution**: Used useEffect with proper cleanup and state management

### Challenge 3: Navigation State
**Problem**: Maintaining exam state during navigation
**Solution**: Implemented proper state lifting and prop drilling

### Challenge 4: Error Handling
**Problem**: Inconsistent error handling across API calls
**Solution**: Centralized error handling in API client with user-friendly messages
